# random_walk_charts
This simple program will generate a stock chart from randomly generated numbers. 
The chart will look very similar to a real stock chart and showing this to someone and revealing to them that this is
actually just a chart made from randomly generated numbers will often blow their mind and make them think twice about technical analysis
and just overall the stock market.
